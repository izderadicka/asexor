ASEXOR
======

ASEXOR = ASynchronous EXecutOR

This module enables to execute defined tasks (processes) on remote machine. So nothing new - but this one 
is based on two relatively new technologies -  [Python Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [WAMP](http://wamp-proto.org/). 

So it's well suited for running tasks for web based applications (for instance file conversions).
